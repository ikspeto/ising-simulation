# Investigating the magnetic properties of a real magnet using a Metropolis algorithm simulation of the Ising Model.
For my final project in high school (Extended Essay in the IB) I chose to make simulation of a magnet in Python (using NumPy and Matplotlib). I used the Monte Carlo method to investigate the effects of temperature, external magnetic fields and the interactions between atoms on the magnetic properties of different types of magnets.

Here are some screenshots from the different experiments:
